BOSTON, Oct. 3 - Facing his opponent for the first time in the presidential campaign, Vice President Al Gore repeatedly hammered away at Gov. George W. Bush for a tax cut proposal that he said would disproportionately benefit the ``wealthiest 1 percent'' of Americans. Mr. Bush, in turn, argued that it was time for a ``different kind of a leader'' who could end the partisan standoff between their two parties in Washington.

From the first question of the 90-minute televised debate, Mr. Gore sought to direct his attack to the details of Mr. Bush's positions. When the moderator, Jim Lehrer of PBS, asked him about his past remarks questioning whether Mr. Bush had enough experience to be president, the Democratic vice president instead spoke of the nation's prosperity.

``I think this is a very important moment for our country,'' Mr. Gore said. ``We have achieved extraordinary prosperity. In this election America has to make an important choice. Will we use our prosperity to enrich not just the few but all our families?''

Mr. Bush used his first chance at the microphone to answer any questions about his experience by saying, ``We know how to set agendas as a governor.'' And he went on to draw sharp ideological lines, accusing Mr. Gore of supporting a program that would ``increase the size of government dramatically.'' Mr. Bush said, ``His plan is three times larger than President Clinton's proposed plan eight years ago.''

The debate ranged across domestic and foreign policy, from Medicare to abortion to how to deal with Slobodan Milosevic's refusal to step down in Serbia. At several points Mr. Gore sighed loudly at Mr. Bush's answers. And Mr. Bush tartly accused the vice president repeatedly of mischaracterizing some of his positions.

``This man is running on `Medi-scare,''' Mr. Bush said, after Mr. Gore said that under the governor's Medicare prescription drug plan ``95 percent of all seniors'' would get no assistance for four or five years.

At another point, Mr. Bush said, ``I'm beginning to think not only did he invent the Internet, he invented the calculator. It's fuzzy math.''

In his continuing effort to sharpen their differences, Mr. Gore said: ``The priorities are just very different. For every new dollar that I propose for spending on health care, Governor Bush spends $3 for a tax cut for the wealthiest 1 percent. Now, for every dollar that I propose to spend on education, he spends $5 on a tax cut for the wealthiest one percent. Those are very clear differences.''

On the issue of RU-486, a newly approved abortion drug, Mr. Bush, who opposes abortion, at first tried to play down the difference between himself and Mr. Gore. He said he did not believe that as president he would have the power to overturn the decision by the Food and Drug Administration to legalize the drug.

When Mr. Lehrer asked Mr. Bush to clarify his position and asked him if he would try to overturn through appointments to the F.D.A. or legislation, Mr. Bush replied, ``I don't think a president can unilaterally overturn it.'' He added, ``Once the decision has been made it's been made.''

But Mr. Bush did say that he wanted Supreme Court justices who ``look at the Constitution as sacred'' and that he believed in ``strict constructionists.''

Mr. Gore immediately tried to sharpen the two men's differences on abortion by turning to the Supreme Court and warning that Mr. Bush had said he would make appointments to the court in the mold of two the court's staunchest conservatives, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas.

``Of Mr. Bush's reference to strict constructionists, Mr. Gore said ``those are code words'' for choosing judges who would overturn Roe v. Wade.

The stakes in the debate were raised by the competitiveness of the presidential race, with polls showing the candidates locked in one of the closest contests in at least two decades.

Mr. Gore, a practiced debater, went into the session at the Boston campus of the University of Massachusetts determined to make the case for continuity while trying not to appear overly combative and aggressive. Shortly before the encounter, he told an ABC News reporter: ``I'm not sure there will be attacks. There won't be any from me.''

The confrontation was particularly critical for Mr. Bush, who was facing his largest television audience - 75 million by some estimates. He was seeking to put to rest any lingering questions about whether he is seasoned and knowledgable enough to be the nation's commander in chief after serving only six years in public life, as the governor of Texas.

A New York Times/CBS News poll taken over the weekend showed that many voters felt Mr. Gore was far better prepared for the White House and better qualified to deal with world leaders and Congress.

When the question of experience came up, Mr. Bush noted pointedly that he comes from Texas, not Washington, and that he has been a chief executive responsible for proposing and carrying out budgets.

He said that his plans for the $4 trillion in projected surpluses over the next decade call for devoting half the money to shoring up Social Security, a quarter for new spending and the last quarter for tax relief.

His spending proposal, Mr. Bush said, ``stands in contrast to my worthy opponent's plan, which will increase the size of government dramatically.'' Mr. Gore's approach, the governor said, would lead to 200 new or expanded federal programs and ``20,000 new bureaucrats.''

``My passion and my vision is to empower Americans to make decisions for their own lives,'' Mr. Bush said.

Responding to a follow-up question, Mr. Gore renewed his commitment to tax cuts for the middle class. And he added that he believed it was time to go to the ``next stage'' of welfare reform, by including rules for fathers on welfare. He did not have time to elaborate.

Mr. Bush then interjected that Mr. Gore was using ``phony numbers'' to describe the governor's budget proposals, adding that the government would be reaping $25 trillion in tax revenues over the next 10 years.

``Why don't we pass $1.3 trillion of that back'' to the taxpayers, Mr. Bush asked. ``My opponent thinks the surplus is the government's money.''

Mr. Bush closed this section of the debate by saying that he took Mr. Gore at his word when he said that he did not question Mr. Bush's credentials for the presidency. Mr. Gore then interrupted to point out that he agreed that the surplus is the American people's money, but questioned why so much of Mr. Bush's proposed tax cuts would go to the wealthiest one percent of Americans.

In turn, Mr. Bush was asked about his criticism of the vice president's leadership abilities, and his answer that turned the question into an extended - and sometimes heated - exchange with Mr. Gore over their rival plans to offer prescription-drug insurance to older Americans.

Since the 1992 election, Mr. Bush said, President Clinton and Mr. Gore had promised to offer a prescription-drug insurance plan under Medicare ``and they can't see to get it done.''

``They blame other folks,'' he said. ``It's time to get someone in Washington to get some positive things done when it comes to our seniors.''

Then driving home a point he has repeated on the campaign trail, Mr. Bush said: ``There's been some missed opportunities. They've had a chance. They've had a chance to form consensus.''

He said his administration was ``going to have immediate help for seniors - an immediate helping hand.''

``If you're happy with Medicare the way it is, fine, you can stay in the program,'' Mr. Bush said. But a Republican administration would offer new options to broaden health insurance for seniors.

``It's time to say say, `let's get it done,''' he said.

Then, continuing on an issue that has been a mainstay of the campaign, Mr. Bush said he would also move quickly to offer new options in the Social Security, including allowing participants to determine how a portion of their retirement funds are invested in private markets.

He said that on the campaign trial, when audiences hear of the plan, ``they begin to nod their heads, and they want a different attitude than Washington.''

Mr. Gore replied with criticism of Mr. Bush's plan, saying that in a Bush administration, many of the elderly would have to wait several years for prescription-drug coverage under Medicare.

``Why is that the wealthiest 1 percent get their tax cuts the first year, but 95 percent of the seniors have to wait four or five years?'' Mr. Gore said. Under the Democrat's plan, he said, ``you go to your own and doctor and your doctor chooses your prescription and no one can take those choices away from you.''

The vice president said that Mr. Bush's proposal for prescription drugs would initially be of no help to middle-income elderly people.

``If you make more than $25,000, you don't get a penny of help'' in the first few years of Mr. Bush's proposal, he said. In the first few years, ``only the poor are covered.''

Mr. Bush responded with what appeared to be anger, saying that Mr. Gore ``is running on Medi-scare - trying to frighten people into the voting booth.''

``We need to reform Medicare,'' he said. ``There's been an opportunity to do so, but this administration has failed to do it.''

Turning to Mr. Gore, he said, ``You've been there for eight years and nothing has been done.'' He accused Mr. Gore of ``old-style Washington politics -- we're going to scare you.''

``He talks about numbers,'' Mr. Bush said in what appeared to be a scripted dig. ``I'm beginning to think that not only did he invent the Internet, but he invented the calculator. It's fuzzy math.''

A question on the energy policy allowed Mr. Gore to return to his attacks on big oil, a point he has been hitting particularly hard in light of rising oil prices and concerns about shortages of heating oil in the Northeast this winter. ``We have to free ourselves from the domination'' of big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate prices. In addition, Mr. Gore said he favored tax incentives for the development of cars, factories and furnaces that consume less fuel.

``We have to bet on the future and move beyond the current technologies,'' Mr. Gore said, promising to ``focus on new technologies that will make us less dependent on big oil or foreign sources.''

Playing off the big oil attack, Mr. Bush noted that he had been ``a small oilman,' and he criticized the Clinton administration for not having an energy policy. ``This is an administration that's had no plan,'' Mr. Bush said.

Mr. Bush again returned to themes from the campaign trail, saying he that he would seek more money to help low-income people with heating and cooling costs, and that he would permit oil exploration in ``a small part of Alaska,'' in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Oil production in this region, he said, would obviate the need for importing a similar amount of oil from Iraq.

But Mr. Gore objected to drilling in the wildlife refuge, saying the United States should not allow oil companies to drill in ``the environmental treasures of our country.''

Questioned about what he would do to ease Mr. Milosevic from power, should he continue to reject the results of elections last week in Yugoslavia, Mr. Gore digressed in an apparent effort to demonstrate his understanding of foreign affairs.

``We should support the people of Serbia and Yugoslavia - as they call Serbia plus Montenegro,'' he said, adding that the support should consist of the prospect of lifted sanctions.

``That is a very strong incentive that we have given them to do the right thing,'' he said. But he warned that emphasizing Mr. Milosevic's vulnerability to prosecution as a war criminal could backfire by inflaming Serbian nationalism. ``We have to be intelligent in the way we go about it.''

Mr. Bush said it was ``time for the man to leave.'' But when he suggested that the Russians should ``step up and lead,'' playing a role in mediating the outcome of the elections, Mr. Gore demurred.

``We may not like the result that comes out of that,'' Mr. Gore said. He noted that the Russians had expressed a preference for proceeding with the runoff elections that the opposition has rejected.

``Well,'' Mr. Bush replied, ``obviously we wouldn't use the Russians if they didn't agree with our answer.''

``Well, they don't,'' Mr. Gore said shortly.

Both candidates said they would oppose the use of force to resolve the standoff.

Mr. Bush was asked under what circumstances he would consider the use of American military force.

He said that he would consider use of force if it were in the ``vital national interest,'' if American territory or that of the nation's allies were threatened, if American lives were at risk or if any of the country's defense alliances were threatened.

But he said he would insist that the mission be clear and achievable, that the the troops be properly equipped and trained, and, lastly, that the nation had a clear ``exit strategy.''

The United States, he said, cannot be the world's policeman.

Mr. Bush said that the military's role is to fight and win wars, and questioned the administration's use of forces in nation-building exercises; he did not specify which of the military deployments of the past eight years he classified that way.

He added that the services were having trouble meeting recruiting goals, that morale was low and that troops were ``overextended in several places.''
